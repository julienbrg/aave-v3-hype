The price is calculated as `underlying_price * exchangeRate`. It is important to note that: - `underlying_price` is the price obtained by the aave-oracle and is subject to it's internal pricing mechanisms. - as the price is scaled over the exchangeRate, but maintains the same precision as the underlying the price might be underestimated by 1 unit. - when pricing multiple `shares` as `shares * price` keep in mind that the error compounds."},"redeemATokens(uint256,address,address)":{"notice":"Burns `shares` of static aToken, with receiver receiving the corresponding amount of aToken"},"refreshRewardTokens()":{"notice":"Fetches all rewardTokens from the incentivecontroller and registers the missing ones."},"rewardTokens()":{"notice":"The IERC20s that are currently rewarded to addresses of the vault via LM on incentivescontroller."},"setPaused(bool)":{"notice":"Pauses/unpauses all system's operations"}},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/=lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/","@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/","ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/","erc4626-tests/=lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/erc4626-tests/","forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/","halmos-cheatcodes/=lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/halmos-cheatcodes/src/","openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/=lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/","openzeppelin-contracts/=lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/","solidity-utils/=lib/solidity-utils/src/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"none"},"compilationTarget":{"src/contracts/extensions/stata-token/interfaces/IStataTokenV2.sol":"IStataTokenV2"},"evmVersion":"shanghai","libraries":{}},"sources":{"lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/interfaces/IERC4626.sol":{"keccak256":"0x666c704c58d4cf404eecd6e4a898a87e25b00b45416678de914e160582c3ff17","urls":["bzz-raw://6def3cc823ae3f155da28a241a8ff91538222053ed9d78f415758a9133e211a1","dweb:/ipfs/QmSriniszojh4UP4WQqxCJhq2XsbCAULcB4qRij4EYw9Gi"],"license":"MIT"},"lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol":{"keccak256":"0xe06a3f08a987af6ad2e1c1e774405d4fe08f1694b67517438b467cecf0da0ef7","urls":["bzz-raw://df6f0c459663c9858b6cba2cda1d14a7d05a985bed6d2de72bd8e78c25ee79db","dweb:/ipfs/QmeTTxZ7qVk9rjEv2R4CpCwdf8UMCcRqDNMvzNxHc3Fnn9"],"license":"MIT"},"lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol":{"keccak256":"0x70f2f713b13b7ce4610bcd0ac9fec0f3cc43693b043abcb8dc40a42a726eb330","urls":["bzz-raw://c13d13304ac79a83ab1c30168967d19e2203342ebbd6a9bbce4db7550522dcbf","dweb:/ipfs/QmeN5jKMN2vw5bhacr6tkg78afbTTZUeaacNHqjWt4Ew1r"],"license":"MIT"},"lib/solidity-utils/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Permit.sol":{"keccak256":"0x27dbc90e5136ffe46c04f7596fc2dbcc3acebd8d504da3d93fdb8496e6de04f6","urls":["bzz-raw://0ea8b92e4245d75a5579c10f22f118f7b4ba07c57341f181f0b2a85ff8663de3","dweb:/ipfs/Qme3Ss5ByjmkxxkMdLpyu7fQ1PCtjNFH1wEFszt2BZePiG"],"license":"MIT"},"src/contracts/extensions/stata-token/interfaces/IERC20AaveLM.sol":{"keccak256":"0x4f9dc53b2a9289e30c38dbc4c4e7f6f8ab0b4ca79cc60014bdbcb3a4706830a9","urls":["bzz-raw://96b4158172d865f596c98996470394c181ce315fb30ed452d2cb4a7998d3be26","dweb:/ipfs/QmXVLP7Jo95zzZ4gV9qRw6MGeGGkucmDrYuBLq226w1fFV"],"license":"MIT"},"src/contracts/extensions/stata-token/interfaces/IERC4626StataToken.sol":{"keccak256":"0x150ba27a2550b27ecbecb737ac1c2ca3ef2b83a3080e26625ea125ae107ce018","urls":["bzz-raw://ac8c49d8a588cd43bb9b1eba40bb9f2f0ec05597d8228bbef3fe8b74e8b9649a","dweb:/ipfs/QmbcZ6nEkuoSncqVoBp3YXdhC3KfeVt6PjvLRpUqufcPJA"],"license":"MIT"},"src/contracts/extensions/stata-token/interfaces/IStataTokenV2.sol":{"keccak256":"0x5373aa71904e6380d71a919664b195ad9d81e3f626e2ba9fcf3decdf657dd463","urls":["bzz-raw://a5f2fbb875093592b29c03ca87a48c7051bb2dd15331473a45a2b71417bb373c","dweb:/ipfs/QmeC7e1znNgBB9c2cNsxSE6h3hLB5HksVgB3B7xpjSsTM4"],"license":"MIT"},"src/contracts/interfaces/IPool.sol":{"keccak256":"0x9b29acbc960b19ec5db42e1835eb6d9a37d6e88de09eab2234518f8a4f194682","urls":["bzz-raw://f995836c3df4a8e434ae9607ee69dd993c4db52db7498e9a74439de0e8bb3e49","dweb:/ipfs/QmQPcJP7HsYe7qf5iorymE3GHWHm1rLhNjACHhShK3w5ZT"],"license":"MIT"},"src/contracts/interfaces/IPoolAddressesProvider.sol":{"keccak256":"0xa60921cf54e91ca8db038effeffc876089b2e72dbf01d68a10ff461770d345e5","urls":["bzz-raw://0de2fd03bf5cd6ae8718a486e5d615c67b260d0608b9fb7076888a4bfaa0e4b4","dweb:/ipfs/QmXpdmxMugyJcBFAGJEruB78bkkuTwrH9esYRaS6wiQoMs"],"license":"MIT"},"src/contracts/protocol/libraries/types/DataTypes.sol":{"keccak256":"0xcaacba608c81a6bdb94cc99b1daf451bcbd60c6a663146e6c630258b22a7f336","urls":["bzz-raw://399a0988113445b5beeff7513eb5355c09c4f291ff65e09e399f16550e4a65fb","dweb:/ipfs/QmQbN4FxqpVkWVT9YFEtLwu8MPSd8yAfCTqvnhArnd6Sc2"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":124}
